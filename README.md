# Productivity Tracker App!

This application will be based on the principles and system I used to track my personal growth and progress.

It will initially feature a simple interface for entering a set of daily goals and assigning each a point value. The user will be prompted at a time of their choosing to fill in their progress daily by checking which of the goals they accomplished and begin to chart their progress as time moves on. The user will be able to see a snapshot of their progress over time. Eventually, when this application is uploaded to the Apple App store and the Google Play Store it will be set to be a private repository.
